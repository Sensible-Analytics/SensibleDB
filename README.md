SensibleDB is a database that makes it easy to build all the components needed for an AI application in a single platform.

You no longer need a separate application DB, vector DB, graph DB, or application layers to manage the multiple storage locations to build the backend of any application that uses AI, agents or RAG. Just use SensibleDB.

SensibleDB primarily operates with a graph + vector data model, but it can also support KV, documents, and relational data.

## Key Features

|                         |                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Built-in MCP tools**  | SensibleDB has built-in MCP support to allow your agents to discover data and walk the graph rather than generating human readable queries. |
| **Built-in Embeddings** | No need to embed your data before sending it to SensibleDB, just use the `Embed` function to vectorize text.                                |
| **Tooling for RAG**     | SensibleDB has a built-in vector search, keyword search, and graph traversals that can be used to power any type of RAG applications.     |
| **Secure by Default**   | SensibleDB is private by default. You can only access your data through your compiled NQL queries.                                    |
| **Ultra-Low Latency**   | SensibleDB is built in Rust and uses LMDB as its storage engine to provide extremely low latencies.                                         |
| **Type-Safe Queries**   | NQL is 100% type-safe, which lets you develop and deploy with the confidence that your queries will execute in production          |
| **Embedded Mode**       | Use SensibleDB as a lightweight embedded database in your Rust applications with zero external dependencies.                               |

## Embedded Mode

SensibleDB can be used as an embedded database in Rust applications. Enable with the `embedded` feature:

```toml
[dependencies]
sensibledb-db = { version = "1.3", features = ["embedded"] }
```

### Quick Start (Embedded)

```rust
use sensibledb_db::embedded::{Database, Node};

let db = Database::open("./my_db")?;
let mut tx = db.write_transaction()?;

tx.put_node(Node {
    id: 1,
    label: "User".into(),
})?;

tx.commit()?;
```

### Embedded Features

- **Storage**: In-memory storage with optional persistence
- **Graph**: Node/edge CRUD with transactions
- **Vector**: Cosine similarity search
- **Traversal**: BFS/DFS graph traversal
- **Indices**: Secondary indices for fast lookups

## Getting Started

#### SensibleDB CLI

Start by installing the SensibleDB CLI tool to deploy SensibleDB locally.

1. Install CLI

   ```bash
   curl -sSL "https://install.sensibledb.com" | bash
   ```

2. Initialize a project

   ```bash
   mkdir <path-to-project> && cd <path-to-project>
   sensibledb init
   ```

3. Write queries

   Open your newly created `.hx` files and start writing your schema and queries.
   Head over to [our docs](https://docs.sensibledb.com/documentation/nql/nql) for more information about writing queries.

   ```js
   N::User {
      INDEX name: String,
      age: U32
   }

   QUERY getUser(user_name: String) =>
      user <- N<User>({name: user_name})
      RETURN user
   ```

4. (Optional) Check your queries compile

   ```bash
   sensibledb check
   ```

5. Deploy your queries to their API endpoints

   ```bash
   sensibledb push dev
   ```

6. Start calling them using our [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/Sensible-Analytics/sensibledb-ts) or [Python SDK](https://github.com/Sensible-Analytics/sensibledb-py). For example:

   ```typescript
   import SensibleDB from "sensibledb-ts";

   // Create a new SensibleDB client
   // The default port is 6969
   const client = new SensibleDB();

   // Query the database
   await client.query("addUser", {
     name: "John",
     age: 20,
   });

   // Get the created user
   const user = await client.query("getUser", {
     user_name: "John",
   });

   console.log(user);
   ```
